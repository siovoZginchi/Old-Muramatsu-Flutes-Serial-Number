## What is a Muramatsu Flute Serial Number?
     
A Muramatsu flute serial number is a unique code that identifies your flute among all the other flutes made by Muramatsu. The serial number is usually stamped on the back of the headjoint, near the lip plate, and on the body of the flute, near the footjoint. The serial number consists of five or six digits, sometimes preceded by a letter.
     
The serial number can tell you when your flute was made, as Muramatsu flutes have been numbered sequentially since 1923, when the first Muramatsu flute was produced by Koichi Muramatsu, the founder of Muramatsu Flutes. The serial number can also tell you what model your flute is, as different models have different prefixes or suffixes in their serial numbers. For example, a DS model has a D prefix, an EX model has an E prefix, and a ST model has an S suffix.
